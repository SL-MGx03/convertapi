### Step 3: Run the Repl

- **Installation:** Once imported, Replit will automatically read the `.replit` and `replit.nix` files. It will begin installing the Nix environment, which includes Node.js and LibreOffice. This step may take a few minutes, and you will see "Re-evaluating Nix file..." in the console.
- **Execution:** After the environment is ready, Replit will run `npm install` and then execute the start command (`node index.js`).

Your API server is now running!

### Step 4: Get Your API URL

Replit automatically hosts your running application. The public URL for your API can be found at the top of the **"Webview"** tab. This is the base URL you will use to make requests.
